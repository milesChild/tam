### Hackathon prompt: Telegram bot to respond to RFQ requests

Our beautiful chatbot on Telegram, purportedly named as such
because of the rumor that a certain Trading Operations team 
lead might pay for the team's lunch in exchange for naming rights. 

The bot aims to automatically respond to RFQ requests from 
counterparties and execute transactions and automate 
the production of services such as trade blotters. RFQs can be 
answered for US equities, with a preliminary workflow and dataset 
set up for US fixed income, futures, and fx with more time. 

By enabling the pricing of risk quotes, NAVs, GMOCs, and others 
types of trades across myriad asset classes we can integrate 
with many different market participants.

Using volatility, market impact projections and position adjusted 
pricing models we've also built a framework that works on its own, 
and can be added onto with more pricing improvements and 
even counterparty prediction models.
